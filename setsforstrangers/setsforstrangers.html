	<p style="font-family: 'PT Sans Narrow', sans-serif; font-size:20px">“Landmark and me” is a project that encourages one to explore the relationship between an architectural landmark and oneself. As one of the world-famous landmark, Flatiron has been a tourist spot that attracting tourists and photographers from all over the world. Flatiron Plaza, located at the north of the building to get the view that shows both the 5th Avenue and Broadway sides of the building. The Plaza has become the best location to photograph the building so it attracted tourists to stay around and take photos. 
	<br><br>
    However, taking photos seems like the only activity that tourists can do. Tourists take photos and the building is photoed, what are the other relationships that we could create to link the inanimate building with animate individuals, to make the trip more valuable for tourist, to create more intimacy between the history of flatiron and individual experience, to create more memories for tourists who travel from far-away places.
