	<p style="font-family: 'PT Sans Narrow', sans-serif; font-size:20px"><!-- “Landmark and me” is a project that encourages one to explore the relationship between an architectural landmark and oneself. As one of the world-famous landmark, Flatiron has been a tourist spot that attracting tourists and photographers from all over the world. Flatiron Plaza, located at the north of the building to get the view that shows both the 5th Avenue and Broadway sides of the building. The Plaza has become the best location to photograph the building so it attracted tourists to stay around and take photos. 
	<br><br>
    However, taking photos seems like the only activity that tourists can do. Tourists take photos and the building is photoed, what are the other relationships that we could create to link the inanimate building with animate individuals, to make the trip more valuable for tourist, to create more intimacy between the history of flatiron and individual experience, to create more memories for tourists who travel from far-away places.  -->

		<h2>Material Study - Method#1</h2><br>
		<p style="font-family: 'PT Sans Narrow', sans-serif; font-size:20px">Description: 
I gathered the most popular 75 meme templates from MEMEGENERATOR.NET to analyses what are the potential perspectives to start the project. I classified the meme templates into three categories: human faces, animals, cartoon characters. Then I classified the human faces into various small groups based on the facial expressions. What I learned is that human faces are one of the most frequently used templates. Even though I could categorize them into various groups based on my understanding of different facial expressions, the actual memes might have totally different contexts with multifarious customized texts. Analyzing the meme template, which is the images, might be partial, however, I think single meme should be read as a form with a fixed image and changeable texts. It could be one way to start the project.

	<h2>Material Study - Method#2</h2>
	<p style="font-family: 'PT Sans Narrow', sans-serif; font-size:20px">Description: While I was studying internet memes, creating our own memes and see how people interact with the meme cards is another ongoing experiment.  I invited 9 people to participate in the little game and asked them to select one card that they feel related to among over 200 cards and pose their faces. I recorded the outcomes and the participators were enjoying the game. What I learned again is human faces have the strong power of expression. What I want to do next is to see how different participators react to the same meme cards. Or to see how one person react to different meme cards.

	<h2>Concept1</h2>
	<p style="font-family: 'PT Sans Narrow', sans-serif; font-size:20px">Description: I want to record how me(24 now) as a netizen for over 10 years and a citizen of China, lived at China for 18 years, and a person who has lived, studied, and worked at America for 6 years, react to different meme cards.  I could create the meme cards according to current social and political contexts. 
<br><br>
The design intention is to courage people to think the social and political things that currently happening, to see how people react differently to the same context, to motivate audiences to think the linkage between their facial expressions and their internal minds. 
<br><br>
One part of the design is recording how I react and another part of the design is an app that users can photograph their facial expressions and create their own collage.
